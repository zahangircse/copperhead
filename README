Copperhead: Data Parallel Python
--------------------------------

Copperhead is a data parallel language embedded in Python,
along with a compiler which creates highly efficient parallel code.
Currently our compiler targets CUDA-enabled GPUs.

Copperhead is hosted at
    http://code.google.com/p/copperhead

Copperhead depends on:
  - CUDA.  We require version 4.1 or better.
  - boost::python.  Tested with version 1.48.  Important note: it is imperative
  that your boost::python library was built with the same compiler as your Python
  interpreter.
  - Codepy.  This will be installed automatically if you do not have it.
  - Thrust.  This comes along with CUDA and does not require special installation.
  
Copperhead runs on OS X and Linux.  It currently does not run on Windows,
although we plan on supporting Windows in the future.

To build Copperhead, you need:
  - g++ version 4.5, supported by nvcc.  CUDA 4.1 supports g++ 4.5, but not
  newer versions.
  - Scons.

For systems with a custom built boost::python, please create a file named
siteconf.py in the top directory, alongside setup.py.  In this file, describe
your boost installation.  For example:
#!/usr/bin/python
BOOST_INC_DIR = "/home/username/boost_1_48_0"
BOOST_LIB_DIR = "/home/username/boost_1_48_0/stage/lib"
BOOST_PYTHON_LIBNAME = "boost_python"

If this information is missing, the build system will attempt to guess, but may fail. 
    
More installation instructions and documentation are found on the website.
